										<h2 id="content">Grief</h2>
										<p> Grief is a natural response to loss. It’s the emotional suffering you feel when something or someone you love is taken away. Often, the pain of loss can feel overwhelming. You may experience all kinds of difficult and unexpected emotions, from shock or anger to disbelief, guilt, and profound sadness. The pain of grief can also disrupt your physical health, making it difficult to sleep, eat, or even think straight.</p>

												<h3>How Long Is Too Long to Mourn?</h3>
												<p>There’s no “normal” amount of time to grieve. Your grieving process depends on a number of things, like your personality, age, beliefs, and support network. The type of loss is also a factor. For example, chances are you’ll grieve longer and harder over the sudden death of a loved one than, say, the end of a romantic relationship.
With time, the sadness eases. You’ll be able to feel happiness and joy along with grief. You’ll be able to return to your daily life.</p>

												<h3>Face your feelings:</h3>
												<p>You can try to suppress your grief, but you can’t avoid it forever. In order to heal, you have to acknowledge the pain. Trying to avoid feelings of sadness and loss only prolongs the grieving process. Unresolved grief can also lead to complications such as depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and health problems.</p>

											<div class="col-3 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Try to maintain your hobbies and interests.</h3>
												<p>There’s comfort in routine and getting back to the activities that bring you joy and connect you closer to others can help you come to terms with your loss and aid the grieving process.</p>

											<div class="col-3 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Plan ahead for grief “triggers.”</h3>
												<p>Anniversaries, holidays, and milestones can reawaken memories and feelings. Be prepared for an emotional wallop, and know that it’s completely normal. If you’re sharing a holiday or life cycle event with other relatives, talk to them ahead of time about their expectations and agree on strategies to honor the person you loved.</p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-3 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Look after your physical health.</h3>
												<p>The mind and body are connected. When you feel healthy physically, you’ll be better able to cope emotionally. Combat stress and fatigue by getting enough sleep, eating right, and exercising. Don’t use alcohol or drugs to numb the pain of grief or lift your mood artificially.</p>

													<h4>Ways of treatment:</h4>
													<dl>
														<dt>Turn to friends and family members.</dt>
														<dd>
															<p> Now is the time to lean on the people who care about you, even if you take pride in being strong and self-sufficient. Rather than avoiding them, draw friends and loved ones close, spend time together face to face, and accept the assistance that’s offered. Often, people want to help but don’t know how, so tell them what you need—whether it’s a shoulder to cry on, help with funeral arrangements, or just someone to hang out with. If you don’t feel you have anyone you can regularly connect with in person, it’s never too late to build new friendships.</p>
														</dd>
														<dt>Accept that many people feel awkward when trying to comfort someone who’s grieving.</dt>
														<dd>
															<p>Grief can be a confusing, sometimes frightening emotion for many people, especially if they haven’t experienced a similar loss themselves. They may feel unsure about how to comfort you and end up saying or doing the wrong things. But don’t use that as an excuse to retreat into your shell and avoid social contact. If a friend or loved one reaches out to you, it’s because they care.</p>
														</dd>
														<dt>Draw comfort from your faith.</dt>
														<dd>
															<p>If you follow a religious tradition, embrace the comfort its mourning rituals can provide. Spiritual activities that are meaningful to you—such as praying, meditating, or going to church—can offer solace. If you’re questioning your faith in the wake of the loss, talk to a clergy member or others in your religious community.</p>
														</dd>
														<dt>Join a support group.</dt>
														<dd>
														</dd>
															<p>Grief can feel very lonely, even when you have loved ones around. Sharing your sorrow with others who have experienced similar losses can help. To find a bereavement support group in your area, contact local hospitals, hospices, funeral homes, and counseling centers, or see the Resources section below.</p>
														<dt>Talk to a therapist or grief counselor.</dt>
														<dd>
															<p>If your grief feels like too much to bear, find a mental health professional with experience in grief counseling. An experienced therapist can help you work through intense emotions and overcome obstacles to your grieving.</p>
