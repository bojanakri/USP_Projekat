										<h2 id="content">Depression</h2>
										<p>Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease a person’s ability to function at work and at home.</p>

												<h3>Know the difference!</h3>
												<p>Being sad is not the same as having depression. The grieving process is natural and unique to each individual and shares some of the same features of depression. Both grief and depression may involve intense sadness and withdrawal from usual activities.They are also different in important ways:</p>

											<!-- Break -->
											<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
												<h3>First:</h3>
												<p>In grief, painful feelings come in waves, often intermixed with positive memories of the deceased. In major depression, mood and/or interest (pleasure) are decreased for most of two weeks.</p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Second:</h3>
												<p>In grief, self-esteem is usually maintained. In major depression, feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing are common.</p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Third:</h3>
												<p>For some people, the death of a loved one can bring on major depression. Losing a job or being a victim of a physical assault or a major disaster can lead to depression for some people. When grief and depression co-exist, the grief is more severe and lasts longer than grief without depression.</p>
