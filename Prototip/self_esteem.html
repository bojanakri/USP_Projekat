										<h2 id="content">Low self-esteem</h2>
										<p>Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease a person’s ability to function at work and at home.</p>

															<tbody>
																<tr>
																	<td>Talk to yourself positively</td>
																	<td>treat yourself as you would your best friend. Be supportive, kind and understanding. Don’t be hard on yourself when you make a mistake.</td>
																</tr>
																<tr>
																	<td>Challenge negative ‘self-talk’</td>
																	<td>every time you criticize yourself, stop and look for objective evidence that the criticism is true. (If you feel you can’t be objective, then ask a trusted friend for their opinion.) You’ll realise that most of your negative self-talk is unfounded.</td>
																</tr>
																<tr>
																	<td>Don’t compare yourself to others </td>
																	<td>recognize that everyone is different and that every human life has value in its own right. Make an effort to accept yourself, warts and all.</td>
																</tr>
																<tr>
																	<td>Appreciate your special qualities</td>
																	<td> remind yourself of your good points every day. Write a list and refer to it often. (If you feel you can’t think of anything good about yourself, ask a trusted friend to help you write the list.)</td>
																</tr>
																<tr>
																	<td>Forget the past</td>
																	<td>concentrate on living in the here-and-now rather than reliving old hurts and disappointments.</td>
																</tr>
																<tr>
																	<td>Exercise</td>
																	<td>it is such a good boost to the brain for all kinds of things but especially in combating depression and helping you to feel good. Targets need to be step by step, such as starting with a walk round the block once a day, enrolling at a local gym class or going for a swim.</td>
